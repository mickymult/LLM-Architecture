# **Mean Activation per Layer for Each Token**


**What does this visualization represent?**

This visualization displays the average activation value for each token across all neurons in each layer of the transformer.

**Components of the Visualization:**

1. **X-Axis**: Represents each layer in the transformer model.
2. **Y-Axis**: Represents the mean activation value.
3. **Lines**: Each line corresponds to a token. The path of the line across layers represents how the mean activation for that token changes from one layer to the next.

**How to Interpret the Visualization:**

1. **Upward Trend**: If the line for a token shows an upward trend, it indicates that the token's mean activation is increasing as it progresses through the layers.
2. **Downward Trend**: A downward trend suggests that the token's significance or influence is decreasing in deeper layers.
3. **Crossing Lines**: If the lines for two tokens cross, it indicates that their relative significance or influence has changed from one layer to another.

**Significance and Use Cases:**

1. **Token Influence Over Layers**: By observing the trends of lines, one can infer how the influence of tokens changes across layers. This can provide insights into the hierarchical feature extraction process of the model.
2. **Comparing Tokens**: The relative positions of lines for different tokens can indicate which tokens are more influential in different layers of the model.

In summary, activation visualizations offer a deep dive into the model's inner workings, helping to shed light on how tokens are processed and how their significance evolves across layers. Like other interpretability tools, they should be used as part of a broader toolkit to understand and explain model behavior.
