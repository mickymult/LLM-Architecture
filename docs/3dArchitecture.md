### Visualizing the 3D Architecture of GPT-2

**Objective:**  
To provide a three-dimensional representation of the GPT-2 model's architecture, allowing us to grasp the depth and structure of the neural network.

**Visualization Overview:**  
The visual showcases a 3D grid where each dot represents a neuron, organized in layers. The depth of the grid signifies the number of layers in the model, while the width and height indicate the neurons' distribution within each layer.

**Interpreting the Visualization:**

1. **Layers:**  
   - The depth of the grid corresponds to the number of layers in the GPT-2 model.
   - GPT-2 Medium has 24 layers, each layer contributing to the model's ability to understand and generate text.
   - As data passes from one layer to the next, it undergoes transformations, allowing the model to extract and refine features from the input.

2. **Neurons:**  
   - Each dot in the visual represents a neuron.
   - Neurons are the fundamental processing units in a neural network. They receive input, process it, and transmit output to other neurons.
   - The GPT-2 Medium model has 1024 neurons in each layer, leading to a total of 24,576 neurons in the entire model.

3. **Attention Heads (annotation):**  
   - The annotation on the side provides a summary, including the number of attention heads.
   - Attention heads enable the model to focus on different parts of the input data. For GPT-2 Medium, there are 16 attention heads in each layer.
   - Multiple attention heads allow the model to capture various features and relationships in the data simultaneously.

**Significance:**  
Understanding the architecture's depth and complexity helps in appreciating the model's capabilities. It showcases the vast number of parameters and operations involved in processing even a short piece of text. This visualization serves as an educational tool for those diving into the world of transformers and GPT-2.

**Usage Tips:**  
- Use the interactive features to zoom in and out, rotate, and pan across the visualization for a detailed view.
- Hover over individual neurons or layers for specific details.
- This visual can serve as a base for more advanced visualizations, like highlighting specific neurons based on activations or showcasing data flow in real-time.
